This is my take on the Wither, designed to make it more of a challenge by introducing brand-new attack patterns and increasing its health to 600 HP, matching the Bedrock Edition Wither. Since not everyone enjoys all the changes, I've included toggles to reduce chaos for more flexibility. However, there will be no "easy" version of this Wither. 

This Wither was created as a personal project to present a tougher fight and primarily to showcase it to friends. It was never meant to be perfect, but I hope it brings a fun challenge.
